                   MORPHEUS
          Follow me.

He leads Neo into the other room, which is cramped with
high-tech equipment, glowing ash-blue and electric green
from the racks of monitors.

Trinity, Apoc and Cypher look up as they enter.

                         MORPHEUS
          Apoc, are we on-line?

                         APOC
          Almost.

He and Trinity are working quickly, hard-wiring a complex
system of monitors, modules and drives.

                         MORPHEUS
          Neo, time is always against us.
          Will you take a seat there?

Neo sits in a chair in the center of the room and Trinity
begins gently fixing white electrode disks to his head,
arms, and the back of his neck.  Near the chair is an old
oval dressing mirror that is cracked.

He whispers to Trinity:

                         NEO
          You did all this?

She nods, placing a set of headphones over his ears.  They
are wired to an old hotel phone.

                         MORPHEUS
          The pill you took is part of a trace
          program.  It's designed to disrupt
          your input/output carrier signal so
          we can pinpoint your location.

                         NEO
          What does that mean?

                         CYPHER
          It means buckle up, Dorothy, 'cause
          Kansas is going bye-bye.

Distantly, through the ear phones, he hears Apoc pounding
on a keyboard.  Sweat beads his face.  His eyes blink and
twitch when he notices the mirror.

Wide-eyed, he stares as it begins to heal itself, a
webwork of cracks that slowly run together as though the
mirror were becoming liquid.
